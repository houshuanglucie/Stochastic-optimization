# Project

## Description

In this project, groups of 4 students will present a well-known or recent
publication in stochastic optimization. Group assignments and topic choices will
be sent during class. Presentations are organized into tracks with different
domains and students will be expected to peer evaluate other presentations in
their track. Project presentations should be 15 minutes and include a
presentation of the paper topic, an illustrative example, and a
contextualization of the work in relationship to other presentations in the same
track. When possible, interactive examples in the form of a Jupyter notebook are
preferred. Presentations can be either a prepared video or a live presentation
online; authors must also be present for follow-up questions.

## Evaluation

Projects will be evaluated based on the following rubric. Each presentation will
be reviewed by one teacher and two other groups; the final grade will be a
weighted average of these three grades.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Topic clarity |   | 5 |
| Example demonstrates topic |   | 5 |
